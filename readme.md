# Zig PostgreSQL Wrapper
This is a pretty basic wrapper for PostgreSQL in Zig.
It utilizes the libpq library written in C. it provides a simple interface for interacting with PostgreSQL databases.

## NOTE
This project contains the whole PQlib so you can just clone the repo and build it, you don't need to install it separately.

I haven't used it with docker yet, it works well with local installation of PostgreSQL.
